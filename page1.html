          <h4>FSEM 101 -- CAUGHT IN THE RYE: THE WORKS OF J. D. SALINGER</h4>
        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

        <h4>FSEM 103 WRITING NEW YORK</h4>
        <p>New York City has always been (and continues to be) a major site of literary and cultural production.

        <h4>FSEM 104 – WHAT WILL YOU EXPLORE?</h4>
        <p>Did you know that taller women wear less makeup? Or that a person’s first memory of seeing a gun affects their attitudes on gun control? Did you know that women are more afraid of rats than men are, but they are not more afraid of roaches? These are just a few of the findings that students of this class produced. So... what do you want to explore? Through a project oriented, workshop style seminar, you will learn the research process from conception to measurement.</p>

        <h4>FSEM 105 – PATRIOTS, HACKERS AND RADICALS: DISSENT IN AMERICA (HONORS ONLY)</h4>
        <p>The Hunger Games. The Pilgrims. Martin Luther King Jr. Oscar Zeta Acosta. Wikileaks. Anonymous. What do these texts, events, and people all have in common? One word: dissent. Dissent has been a crucial concept from the earliest American colonies until today. This class will grapple with the different manifestations of this seemingly quintessential American concept.</p>

      <div class="column3">
        <h4>FSEM 108 — SCIENCE OR PSEUDOSCIENCE?</h4>
        <p>Why do people believe weird things? You’ll learn to develop a healthy skepticism by learning to distinguish real science from pseudoscience, explore the psychological processes that make pseudoscience so appealing, and figure out for yourself whether the next weird thing is “too good to be true.”</p>

        <h4>FSEM 110 — FROM POR- TRAIT TO SELFIE: VISUAL HISTORIES OF ME</h4>
        <p>It’s Saturday night, you’re looking fresh, you Instagram yourself. It’s Saturday night 1659, and Rembrandt van Rijn dabs his brush in oil paint as he puts the finishing touches on another self-portrait. Portraits, like selfies, communicate what it means to be human, as well as how people fashion identities. We investigate the genre of portraiture and learn to look and think critically about portrait images that we see and create everyday.</p>

        <h4>FSEM 111 — VERSAILLES: PALACE OF THE SUN.</h4>

        <h4>FSEM 112 — FROM OPPRESSION TO OPPORTUNITY FOR WOMEN</h4>
        <p>In Half the Sky, NY Times editor Nicholas Kristof and his wife, Sheryl WuDunn, two fiercely moral voices, take us on a journey through Africa and Asia to meet extraordinary women struggling there because of human rights violations. Through this work, we will learn that the key to economic progress lies in unleashing women’s potential, not in accepting the sexual slavery of women.</p>

      <div class="column2">
        <h4>FSEM 113 —-LOVE AMONG THE PEAR TREES: AUGUSTINE’S CONFESSIONS.</h4>
        <p>Friends, temptations, relationships, parents, studying, worrying about the future, God, happiness. Sound familiar? These are the concerns of many college students. They were also the concerns of Augustine, a fourth century student, teacher, playboy, and, finally, a bishop. As you get to know Augustine better, you will get to know yourselves better, and you too will be set on the path to discovering meaning and love.</p>

        <h4>FSEM 114 —- REEL CITIES: CINEMATIC URBAN EXPERIENCE</h4>
        <p>The real city and the reel city mirror each other in mutual representation. Can cinema help us understand urban issues and problems? Modernity links urban studies and cinema. The boundary between reel and real is blurred through differ- ent cities in films such as <i>Blade Runner</i>, <i>Taxi Driver</i>, <i>The Truman Show</i>, <i>City of God</i>, <i>City of Ghost</i>, among many others.</p>
